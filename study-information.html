            .Moreover, when I was in high school I thought that I'm very smart but when i went to University, <i>anyone here make me feel I'm really
            unacknowledge</i>, they are really good i very admire their knowledge and their skill and it's also a motivation for me every day. And I have also planned a schedule for my learning path like that:
