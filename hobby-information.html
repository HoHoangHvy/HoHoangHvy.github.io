            <ul>
                <li><b>Badminton:</b> I just play it recently but i found it really exciting. I like the feeling of moving on the court and the sound from the racket when i hit a shuttle </li>

At the beggining of working out i just want to improve my strenght, but for a long time it become my routine, i feel like i can't live without gym, it's not only make me fell stronger but also make my body look good.
